  ## Installation
  Node.js is require to be isntalled on your machine to run this application. After cloning the repository to your local machine, run that command `npm i` or `npm install` to install node modules as well as the dependencies contained in the `./package.json` file. Once this is complete, run the command `node app.js` in your terminal shell to start the program. You will be prompted with a menu of various tasks you can select to build out your employee database. If the database doesn't connect, go ahead and use the information at the top of the app.js file to login into mysql in your terminal ( `mysql -u root -p` ). From there all you need to do is type msql>`source db/schema.sql;` hit `enter` and the database tables will be created. Additionally, you can also `source db/seeds.sql;` to view an example setup with departments, employees, and their roles.
